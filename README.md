# Preparing for Influenza Season in USA 
In the United States, during the flu season, a higher number of people, especially those in vulnerable groups, experience flu-related complications, leading to increased hospitalizations. As a result, hospitals and clinics require additional staff to handle the number of patients.

## Problem

Identifying the states with the highest number of vulnerable populations and determining the quantities for deploying medical personnel to each state to prepare hospitals for the upcoming flu season.

## Objective

Perform statistical analysis on influenza patterns to anticipate and prepare for staffing allocation across the country.

## Hypothesis

If a state has a higher proportion of persons aged 65 and up, then such a state will have a higher influenza-related death rate.

## Key Insights

I used statistical analysis to explore the relationships between variables and identified a weak positive correlation between the number of deaths and the population older than 65. This suggests that a slight increase in the proportion of individuals aged 65 and above is associated with a mild rise in the death ratio.

### Which age groups are most affected by influenza?

I created this bar chart to identify demographic groups most at risk, and it was discovered that vulnerable population refers to groups of individuals under 5 years old and over 65 years old.

### Which states have the highest number of vulnerable populations?

I have discovered that the states in the East have a higher death rate, and the density of the population significantly influences the death count.

### What does the future bring?

## Results

With 95% confidence, we can draw the conclusion that:
- The highest growth in the number of deaths is projected for the Midwest region at 5.7%.
- The growth in the number of deaths is also expected in the South and Northeast regions.
- In the year 2018, influenza-related deaths in the West region are forecasted to remain constant.
